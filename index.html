<h1>Soccer</h1>


<p>I have been playing soccer ever since I can remember. Since I was seven years old, soccer has been my whole world. Spring and fall, every year would bring a new and exciting season to look forward to. I made friends on my very first team that I'm still friends with today. Even though not everyone on my first team still plays soccer, it is still a major part of a lot of our lives. The excitement of the game, the competitiveness, and the feeling of winning is what makes it all worth it.<p/>

<h1>What About Today?</h1>
<p>Today, I play <a href="http:/www.carolinaelitesc.com/"> CESA</a> club soccer in the fall and <a href="https://www.planeths.com/">J.L. Mann </a> soccer in the spring. I travel in South Carolina mostly for CESA in the fall to play teams from around the area. I really like CESA because they are serious about soccer and encourage me to try my best in every game and practice and keep me in shape for high school soccer. I have learned a LOT over the years and have only ever played soccer with CESA, other than school soccer, and to me that is what makes CESA special. J.L. Mann soccer has also been a good experience where I have learned a lot. This past year was my first year playing Mann soccer and I made new friends that I see at school during the day. We joke around, encourage each other, and bring out the best of each other as a team.<p/>

<p>It's hard sometimes; all of the running and conditioning in the heat, but it makes a difference in the game when you are still in shape enough and have endurance where you can still outrun the opponents. One of the reasons soccer is my favorite hobby is because I am in shape and can run faster and longer than most people I know. It's not always fun, but I feel good about myself when I do well after a hard practice or conditioning. Sometimes to make it not so harsh, our coach makes it into a game or competition to motivate us to do well. It is times like these that soccer helps us strive for greatness and to be the best person we can be, on and off the field.<p/>
<h1>In the End...</h1>
<p>Rain or shine, snow or not, soccer is my favorite hobby and sport. I will never forget the memories and friends I have made over the years. I love everything about soccer from the running to the scoring to the good times. Being a team is what it's all about at the end of the day, and it's exciting when I'm on a new team because I learn to trust new people and get to know a new coach.<p/>
